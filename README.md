# sprint-security-tutorial_level1
This is a tutorial for creating spring apps with spring security framework for beginners

---

### For this session, we are going to add a static user in the `Application.properties` file. This way spring will know that a custom user has been informed and will not create the default user.

### This is a test application so we are creating a static user, normally this practice does not apply to real applications. In the next sessions we will have our most dynamic users and saved in a database, but as you can see, we are starting to customize spring security.
